# flutter_infinite_list

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

Observe state changes with BlocObserver.
BlocProvider, Flutter widget which provides a bloc to its children.
BlocBuilder, Flutter widget that handles building the widget in response to new states.
Adding events with context.read.
Prevent unnecessary rebuilds with Equatable.
Use the transformEvents method with Rx.


REST API
For this demo application, we’ll be using jsonplaceholder as our data source.
jsonplaceholder is an online REST API which serves fake data; it’s very useful for building prototypes.

https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?_start=0&_limit=2 to see what the API returns.
In our url we specified the start and limit as query parameters to the GET request.
